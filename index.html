            <p>it was stolen glances at first. nothing more than intrigue, a whisper of attraction. in between coffee sips, pilfered looks under innocent pretenses. we'd both caught the other staring, but there was nothing to be thought of it. <i>he must lock eyes with every other pretty girl that walks by.</i> but then, against my better judgement, it became routine. a part of my day. a much anticipated part, even. as soon as i rounded the corner, i would look for you. and somehow, your eyes would find mine, no matter the crowd. these looks i purloined were like small pieces i was puzzling together to solve the riddle that was you. the familiarly unfamiliar bend in your neck when you laughed at something you found particularly funny. the perpetual look on your face that suggested you were trying to solve something unsolvable. the confident air of mystery you had around you. your <i>arrogance</i>, and the way you looked at <i>me</i>. you would turn to look at me with eyes that already knew i was watching you. for weeks, i raged an internal debate with myself trying to decipher the expression on your face. was it lust? curiousity? indifference? some days i would go so far as to speculate it was jealousy, at seeing me with another boy. i thought about you, a complete stranger, more than i'd like to admit. and then one day, after a long day of not seeing you, before i knew what i was doing, before the neurons in my brain could signal the muscles in my face to stop, i saw you and i <i>smiled at you</i>. i smiled at you? and for some reason, i couldn't stop. i couldn't stop smiling at the bewildered expression on your face, all the while internally kicking myself. you must've thought i was touched in the head. </p>
            <p>you disappeared for a bit after that, to my dismay. i asked around about you, any attempt at subtelty being sabotaged by my friends' antics, as you very well know. i began losing hope. but then, that one story, and that one reply.</p>
            <p>that was the beginning of the first year of the rest of our lives.</p></p>

            there's so much left. so many tears, so much joy, arguments, weddings, babies, parties, anniversaries. endless days. constant change, but time seems to stand still. it's overwhelming to think about, and a little scary. you can only hope that in the end it'll all be worth it. you can hope that one day you'll be able to look back on the decisions you made, with no regrets about the people you chose and the things you did. when we were young, we were free of consequence. but taking responsibility for your actions is the tax you pay on age. now we're at the brink of change, the liminal space stretching out in between the turning of pages. it's not here yet, this next change, but it's fast approaching. i can taste it in the air, the slightly sweet tang of fond memories left behind to make way for new ones. it feels like a warm hug long forgotten. it feels like i'm smack dab in the middle of the greatest days of my life; i just don't know it yet. but, as long as i get to spend the rest of them by your side, i can weather storm and sunshine.

          <p>nights spent in crippling distance, falling asleep against the sound of your breathing, days spent in oblivion, counting down the minutes, hours, weeks before i get to see you again. my mind, to make up for your absence, playing and replaying a montage of mental snapshots of your face and your lips, the way you tasted, your hand in mine, and a smile that lit my whole world up. remembering the backroom of that bar where we got upto no good, your hand on the inside of my thigh slowly inching up, and the cadence of your voice telling me that you loved me in perfect harmony with the shape of the smoke leaving your mouth. the corners of my mouth turning up of their own volition whenever i was reminded that you're <i>mine</i>. feeling whole in a way that drowned out all the noise in my head, all the insignificant chatter. because it's just you and me now. and it's everything i could ever want.</p>

                we walked to mcdonald's in the pouring rain, with the water dripping from your cupid's bow and your gloriously wet hair wreaking havoc on me. we took refuge at a flower shop, and left with a pack of cigarettes. after dinner, we boozed up in our shady hotel room (courtesy of my friends), which we quickly sobered up from with cigarettes and a few kisses. you tried to teach me how to properly throw a punch (for "self-defense"), unaware of the irony of the situation. later, in the dark, you kissed away all my insecurities and showed me love like i'd never seen before, cradling me in the circle of your arms like you were afraid i'd break. we talked about the future, <i>our</i> future, and my worry became apparent on my face, but you promised me it'll all work out. that somehow, we would make it work. because you can't imagine a life without me, and i can't go back to the life i was living before you. i didn't realize what was missing in my fuzzy, unfocused black-and-white life until i found you. now, this brilliant color feels like a dream in 4k. i know that if i lose this, if i lose you, it will destroy me. it will wreck me from the inside out, my heart, my lungs. my skin will burn with the memory of you touching it and i will not be anything, or anyone's, because i will not be yours anymore. but you tell me i should stop being so pessimistic, so i'll listen to you.

                    you're my superglue. you're fixing everything broken, all the cracks and fissures in my heart. i hadn't known what love was before you, not truly. you made me realize that love is supposed to make you want to be <i>good</i>, a better person, not bring out the worst in you. it's supposed to fill you up with happiness and light, not force your mind into the darkest corners. you have changed me in ways i never thought possible, unlocked parts of me that i'm learning to love. sadness was the emotion that used to fuel my writing, but now it's love, and happiness. was this fate, or pure dumb luck?

            pineapple mint kisses in the sun, <br>

                i don't remember the song we slow-danced to in the middle of the room that we rented for two hours. what i remember is the translucent light through the frosted glass window, the way it illuminated our skin, the way we swayed in the summer heat under the creaky fan. just the two of us. i don't remember the song, but i remember how i felt. i felt so heart-wrenchingly sad, because i knew that this was goodbye. i remember your heartbeat in my ear, your sigh in my hair, your hands against my bare skin. i remember all the words we left unsaid, floating in the ether between us. i became so irrevocably aware of the intensity with which i loved you. in that moment, every moment leading upto it, and every moment that was to come thereafter --- i knew i would love you so absolutely, so completely that i could never love anyone else after you. and with this revelation i handed to you power over me that nobody has ever held. you have the ability to shatter me into a million tiny pieces, to damage me beyond salvation.</p>

                <p>you held my face in the palm of your hand, and i looked at you like i was finally home.

            there is no emotion that can come remotely close to the feeling of being in love. <i>love</i>. something that mocked me with its unattainability for so long i started losing hope in its very existence. up until now. it feels like a fever dream, but in the best possible way. love, is the heightening of all your other emotions. love is the way you tilt your head to the right when you laugh. love is the way you fall asleep in my arms. love is the way you grab my hand when we cross the street. i found love in something so unexpected, i still can't believe it's real. it's scary, and it fills up my whole chest to the point i have no space left in my lungs for air. i'm absolutely terrified of ruining this, of dropping the ball, of falling into old patterns. but for now, i have it. i have it in the palm of my hand, and god knows i will hold on tight.
